pyvlfeat - A high-level Python wrapper around a subset of the VLFeat library
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An humble modification to support both Windows 8.1 and Linux.
I could not test on OSX/Darwin.

Linux build / installation should be pretty straightforward on recent distributions.
The only tricky part is the Boost.Python dependency; make sure the library is available and named "libboost_python.so" or "libboost_python.a". You may need to edit the config.py file otherwise (LinkArgs line for Linux).

The Windows build / installation was really tricky (at least for me as a non-expert Windows user) as it requires to provide the right toolchain and Boost.Python library.
I listed the steps which enabled me to build this extension on Windows 8.1 Pro x64 in a separate file: INSTALL_WINDOWS.txt

I would be happy to spend a few hours merging my work with the one of the original maintainers (to avoid duplicating code), or to integrate a couple of pull requests.
